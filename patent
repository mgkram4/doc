### BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Traditional biometric estimation systems suffer from limited accuracy, single-modality analysis, and lack of continuous improvement mechanisms. Existing solutions typically focus on either demographic analysis or body measurements in isolation, without leveraging the synergistic benefits of combining physiological data with body estimation algorithms. Furthermore, current systems lack the ability to learn from user feedback and adapt their algorithms for improved accuracy over time.

Prior art in biometric estimation includes basic computer vision approaches for height and weight estimation, facial recognition systems for demographic analysis, and separate physiological monitoring devices. However, no existing system combines comprehensive physiological monitoring with advanced body measurement estimation in a unified dual-phase pipeline that incorporates reinforcement learning from human feedback for continuous accuracy improvement.

### SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides a novel biometric estimation system that addresses the limitations of existing technologies through several key innovations:

1. **DUAL-PHASE PROCESSING ARCHITECTURE**: A sophisticated two-phase pipeline that sequentially performs physiological monitoring followed by advanced body estimation, with the physiological data informing and optimizing the body measurement algorithms.

2. **ENHANCED PHYSIOLOGICAL SCANNER**: An advanced system that combines multiple analysis techniques including MediaPipe Face Mesh processing with 468 facial landmarks, photoplethysmography (PPG) for heart rate extraction, thermal analysis for temperature estimation, pulse morphology analysis for blood pressure estimation, and multi-modal AI demographic analysis.

3. **ADVANCED BODY ESTIMATOR**: A comprehensive body measurement system incorporating YOLOv8 person detection, MediaPipe pose processing with 33 body landmarks, MiDaS transformer-based depth estimation, Segment Anything Model (SAM) for body segmentation, SMPL-X parametric 3D body model fitting, and multi-factor height and weight calculation algorithms.

4. **REINFORCEMENT LEARNING FROM HUMAN FEEDBACK (RLHF)**: A continuous improvement system that collects ground truth measurements from users, validates feedback quality, generates training data for model refinement, and implements real-time algorithm adaptation while maintaining privacy through data anonymization.

5. **INTEGRATED ALGORITHM CALIBRATION**: A configuration system that uses physiological data to optimize body measurement algorithms through demographic, metabolic, and physiological adjustments.
