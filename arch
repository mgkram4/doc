## AI/ML Algorithms and Computer Vision Techniques

## 7. Detailed Algorithm Explanations

### 7.1 Face Analysis Algorithms

#### MediaPipe Face Mesh
The system uses Google's MediaPipe Face Mesh for robust facial landmark detection:
- **Algorithm**: Deep neural network trained on diverse facial data
- **Output**: 468 3D facial landmarks with confidence scores
- **Application**: Provides precise facial geometry for demographic analysis and physiological measurements
- **Improvement**: Continuously adapts to lighting conditions and face orientations through temporal smoothing

#### Photoplethysmography (PPG) for Heart Rate
Heart rate detection uses camera-based PPG analysis:
- **Algorithm**: Analyzes subtle color variations in facial skin caused by blood volume changes
- **Signal Processing**: Bandpass filtering (0.75-4 Hz) to isolate cardiac frequency
- **Peak Detection**: Scipy's find_peaks with adaptive thresholding
- **Improvement**: Learns optimal face regions and filtering parameters from user feedback

#### Temperature Estimation
Non-contact temperature measurement using thermal analysis:
- **Algorithm**: Analyzes facial thermal patterns using color temperature correlation
- **Calibration**: Uses ambient temperature and user-specific baseline correction
- **Validation**: Cross-references with physiological indicators (heart rate, perspiration)
- **Improvement**: Builds user-specific thermal profiles for increased accuracy

### 7.2 Body Analysis Algorithms

#### YOLO Person Detection
Uses YOLOv8 for robust person detection and localization:
- **Architecture**: Convolutional neural network with attention mechanisms
- **Performance**: Real-time detection with >95% accuracy
- **Output**: Bounding boxes, confidence scores, and keypoints
- **Improvement**: Fine-tunes detection thresholds based on environmental conditions

#### SMPL-X Body Model
Advanced 3D human body modeling for precise measurements:
- **Algorithm**: Parametric model with shape and pose parameters
- **Fitting**: Optimization-based fitting to detected keypoints
- **Measurements**: Extracts anthropometric measurements from fitted model
- **Improvement**: Learns population-specific shape priors from user data

#### MiDaS Depth Estimation
Monocular depth estimation for 3D body analysis:
- **Architecture**: Vision Transformer-based depth predictor
- **Training**: Pre-trained on diverse indoor/outdoor scenes
- **Application**: Provides depth information for accurate height calculation
- **Improvement**: Domain adaptation for specific camera setups and environments

### 7.3 Height Estimation Algorithm

The height estimation combines multiple approaches:

```python
def estimate_height(keypoints, depth_map, camera_params):
    # 1. Keypoint-based estimation
    head_to_toe_pixels = calculate_pixel_distance(keypoints['head'], keypoints['toe'])
    
    # 2. Depth-based scaling
    avg_depth = get_average_depth(depth_map, keypoints)
    real_world_scale = calculate_scale_factor(camera_params, avg_depth)
    
    # 3. Proportion-based validation
    body_proportions = analyze_body_proportions(keypoints)
    height_estimate = head_to_toe_pixels * real_world_scale
    
    # 4. Ensemble prediction
    final_height = ensemble_predict([
        height_estimate,
        proportion_based_height(body_proportions),
        anthropometric_height(keypoints)
    ])
    
    return final_height
```

**Improvement Mechanism**: The system learns optimal weighting for ensemble components based on user feedback accuracy.

### 7.4 Weight Estimation Algorithm

Weight estimation uses a multi-modal approach:

```python
def estimate_weight(height, body_volume, demographics, physiological_data):
    # 1. BMI-based initial estimate
    base_weight = calculate_bmi_weight(height, demographics)
    
    # 2. Body volume correction
    if body_volume:
        density_factor = estimate_body_density(demographics, physiological_data)
        volume_weight = body_volume * density_factor
    
    # 3. Physiological adjustments
    metabolic_factor = calculate_metabolic_factor(
        heart_rate=physiological_data['heart_rate'],
        temperature=physiological_data['temperature']
    )
    
    # 4. Bayesian ensemble
    weight_estimate = bayesian_ensemble([
        base_weight,
        volume_weight if body_volume else None,
        metabolic_adjusted_weight(base_weight, metabolic_factor)
    ])
    
    return weight_estimate
```

**Improvement Mechanism**: Bayesian updating incorporates user feedback to refine population-specific parameters.

2. **Catastrophic Forgetting Prevention**: Uses elastic weight consolidation
3. **Domain Adaptation**: Adjusts to new environments and user populations
4. **Meta-Learning**: Learns how to learn more efficiently from limited data
